Time Complexity - The O Notation

O(1) - Constant Time

O(n) - Linear Time

O(Log n) - Logarithmic time

O(n^2) - Quadratic Time

O(n + m) - Linear Time

An Average computer can perform 10^8 = 100 million in less than a second

For good implementation check this:

n <= 10^6 -> implement solution 0(n) or O (nlogn)

n <= 10^4 -> implement O(n^2) or previous

n <= 10^3 -> implement O(n^3) or previous

Use these values as a reference, only.
